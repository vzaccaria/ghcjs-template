* What is this

This is just a template project for building programs with GHCJS + STACK

To build :

- Clone this repo
- =stack build gtk2hs-buildtools=
- =stack build --install-ghc --stack-yaml=stack-ghcjs.yaml=

Note: if you get any error concerning a =/root/.local/bin= being inaccessible
while building =StateVar= then you should change permissions of that directory
(and create it if it does not exist).

The cabal file is starterApp.cabal. It compiles Main.hs into a Javascript file.

* How to compile

To compile Main.hs:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh     :results none   
stack build --stack-yaml=stack-ghcjs.yaml
#+END_SRC
